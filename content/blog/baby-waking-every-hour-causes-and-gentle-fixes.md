## You're Not Doing Anything Wrong

If your baby is waking every hour, or every two hours, or seemingly the moment you tiptoe back to bed, you are not alone and you are not failing. Frequent night wakings are one of the most common reasons parents seek help, and the causes are almost always fixable once you know what to look for.

The hard part is that "baby waking every hour" can mean several different things. A newborn cycling through short sleep stretches is doing something completely normal. A six-month-old who was sleeping longer stretches and suddenly isn't might be dealing with something else entirely. And a baby who wakes 45 minutes after bedtime every single night is telling you something very specific.

Let's untangle all of it.

## Why Your Baby Is Waking So Often at Night

Frequent night wakings in babies rarely come down to a single cause. More often, it's a combination of factors stacking on top of each other. Understanding the most common ones helps you figure out which levers to pull first.

### Sleep Associations

This is the big one. A sleep association is anything your baby relies on to fall asleep that they can't recreate on their own when they naturally wake between sleep cycles. Research from Dr. Jodi Mindell's lab at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has consistently shown that how a baby falls asleep at bedtime is the strongest predictor of how often they wake overnight.

Every human, babies included, cycles through light and deep sleep roughly every 45 minutes to 2 hours. At the end of each cycle, we briefly surface toward wakefulness. Adults roll over and drift back off without remembering. But if your baby fell asleep while being rocked, fed, or held, they wake up and the conditions have changed. The rocking stopped. The breast or bottle is gone. They need you to recreate those conditions before they can fall back asleep.

This isn't a flaw in your baby. It's completely logical from their perspective. But it does explain why some babies wake every single sleep cycle overnight, sometimes every hour or even every 45 minutes.

### Baby Wakes After 45 Minutes at Bedtime: The False Start

If your baby falls asleep at bedtime and then wakes crying 30 to 45 minutes later, you're dealing with what sleep consultants call a "false start." This is one of the most frustrating patterns because you've just done the whole bedtime routine, finally sat down, and now you're back at square one.

False starts usually point to one of two things. The first is overtiredness. When a baby is awake too long before bed, their body produces cortisol as a compensatory stress response. That cortisol burst helps them *fall* asleep, sometimes quite quickly, but it fragments the first sleep cycle and jolts them awake shortly after. If your baby crashes fast at bedtime but pops up 40 minutes later, check whether the last wake window is too long.

The second common cause is a sleep association tied specifically to the onset of sleep. The baby falls asleep in your arms, you transfer them to the cot, and when they surface at the end of that first cycle, they register the change and wake fully. The fix for each cause is different, so identifying which one you're dealing with matters.

### Undertired or Overtired: The Schedule Factor

Sleep pressure, the biological drive to sleep, needs to be just right. Too little awake time before bed and your baby doesn't have enough sleep pressure to stay in deeper sleep. Too much and the cortisol response kicks in, leading to fragmented sleep and those false starts.

Baby waking every 2 hours is often a schedule issue in disguise. The nap schedule may need adjusting, particularly if daytime sleep is too long, too late, or poorly timed relative to bedtime. A baby who naps until 4:30 p.m. and then goes to bed at 7 p.m. may not have built enough sleep pressure for a solid first stretch.

### Hunger

Genuine hunger is a completely valid reason for night waking, particularly in babies under six months. Newborns need frequent feeds around the clock, and many babies continue to need one or two night feeds well into the second half of their first year. The AAP acknowledges that night feeding patterns vary widely and that some babies need overnight nutrition longer than others.

The question isn't whether your baby wakes to feed, it's whether *every* waking is driven by hunger or whether hunger is being used to solve a different problem (like a feed-to-sleep association). If your baby takes a full feed at some wakings but only comfort sucks for 30 seconds at others, the pattern is worth examining.

### Developmental Leaps and Regressions

Babies' brains are doing extraordinary things in the first two years, and big developmental shifts often disrupt sleep temporarily. The well-documented four-month sleep regression, for example, is actually a permanent change in sleep architecture as your baby's cycles begin to resemble adult patterns. Other common disruption points include learning to roll, pull to stand, and major language bursts.

These phases are real and they do pass, usually within one to three weeks. But here's the nuance: a regression can expose an underlying sleep association that was previously masked by immature sleep cycles.

## Is This a Regression or a Schedule Issue?

This is one of the most important questions to ask, because the answer changes your response entirely.

**Signs it's a regression:** The disruption started suddenly, your baby recently hit a developmental milestone or is clearly working on one, they're fussy or clingy during the day too, and the timing aligns with a common regression age (4 months, 8-10 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years). Regressions usually resolve on their own if you avoid introducing new sleep associations in the process.

**Signs it's a schedule issue:** The wakings have been gradually getting worse over days or weeks. Your baby's nap schedule hasn't been updated recently even though they've grown. They seem either wired at bedtime (overtired) or wide awake and playful in the cot (undertired). Naps are consistently short or bedtime takes a long time.

**Signs it's both:** A regression can land on top of a schedule that was already slightly off, making everything worse. In this case, gently adjusting the schedule while riding out the regression gives you the best outcome.

## What to Change First Without Sleep Training

You don't have to commit to a formal sleep training method to make meaningful improvements. In fact, research published in *Pediatrics* and reviewed by the AAP shows that environmental and routine adjustments alone can significantly reduce night wakings for many families. Here's where to start:

**Audit the last wake window.** This single change fixes more sleep problems than almost anything else. If your baby is having false starts or waking frequently in the first half of the night, try shortening the last wake window by 15 to 20 minutes for a few days and see what shifts.

**Make the sleep environment boring.** A comfortably cool room, genuinely dark with blackout curtains, and white noise at a consistent volume. Around 16-20C can be a useful benchmark, but if your climate is warmer, prioritize overheating prevention with lighter sleepwear, lower TOG, and airflow. The NHS and AAP both recommend keeping the sleep space simple, dark, and free of stimulation. These aren't luxuries, they remove variables that can cause unnecessary wakings.

**Separate feeding from falling asleep.** You don't have to eliminate feeding before bed. Just move it earlier in the routine so there's a gap between the last feed and being placed in the cot. Even a short buffer, a book, a song, a cuddle, can begin to weaken a feed-to-sleep association over time.

**Watch for split-second timing at transfer.** If you're putting your baby down already asleep, try putting them down drowsy but still aware of the transfer. This is not an all-or-nothing change. Even partial awareness at the moment of being placed down can help your baby recognise their sleep space and resettle more easily between cycles.

**Keep a simple sleep log for three to five nights.** Write down bedtime, each waking, what you did, and wake-up time. Patterns that feel random in the fog of exhaustion often reveal themselves clearly on paper. This is exactly what LunaCradle's sleep diary is designed to do, it tracks your entries and surfaces patterns you'd otherwise miss, then adjusts your baby's personalised plan based on what the data shows.

## When to Talk to a Doctor

Most frequent night wakings are behavioural and resolve with the kinds of changes described above. But some causes are medical, and it's important to know when to seek help.

**Talk to your pediatrician or GP if:** your baby seems in pain during wakings (arching, pulling legs up, screaming inconsolably), you notice loud or laboured breathing, snoring, or pauses in breathing during sleep, your baby is not gaining weight appropriately, the wakings are accompanied by fever, vomiting, or other illness signs, or nothing you've tried over two to three weeks has made any difference.

Conditions like reflux, food intolerances, ear infections, and obstructive sleep apnoea can all cause frequent wakings and are easily missed when parents assume the problem is behavioural. A quick check with your doctor can rule these out and give you peace of mind.

## You Will Sleep Again

Frequent night wakings are exhausting, disorienting, and lonely at 3 a.m. But they're also one of the most solvable baby sleep problems once you understand what's driving them. Start with the environment and schedule, watch for patterns, and give changes a few days to take effect before switching tactics.

If you want help identifying exactly what's behind your baby's wakings, LunaCradle builds a personalised sleep plan around your baby's age, temperament, and current patterns. The sleep diary tracks night wakings alongside naps and bedtime, and our weekly reviews pinpoint what to adjust next. Think of it as having a sleep consultant in your pocket, one that learns your baby's rhythms and adapts as they grow.

You're doing harder work than most people will ever understand. Trust yourself, trust the process, and know that this phase does end.
