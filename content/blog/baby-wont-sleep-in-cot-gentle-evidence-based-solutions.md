If your **baby won't sleep in cot** and wakes the second you put them down, you are not failing. This is one of the most common sleep struggles in the first year. Most babies are not resisting the cot because they are stubborn. They are reacting to change: different texture, different temperature, and less physical closeness than your arms.

The encouraging part is that cot confidence is a skill most babies can learn with steady, responsive support.

## Why a Baby Won't Sleep in Cot Even When Tired

Cot refusal is usually a mix of sleep associations, sensory transition, and timing. If a baby falls asleep while feeding or rocking, they often notice the change when they partially wake and realize they are now in a different environment. At the same time, overtiredness can make that transition feel even harder.

Developmental windows can amplify this pattern. Around major milestones, babies become more sensitive to separation and more alert to environment changes. That can temporarily increase bedtime protest, even if your routine was working last week.

## Build a Sleep Space That Feels Predictable

Before changing settling techniques, stabilize the environment. Keep the cot setup simple and safe: firm mattress, fitted sheet, clear sleep space, and back sleeping position. A dark room and steady white noise often reduce startle wakeups and environmental distraction.

Comfort also matters. A consistent sleep sack and stable room temperature can make the transition from arms to cot feel less abrupt. You are trying to create a setting that feels familiar every night.

## Gentle Techniques That Usually Work Better Than "Starting Over"

Parents often see better progress with small repeatable steps than with dramatic changes. Start by placing baby in the cot drowsy but still aware for a short interval, then offer in-cot reassurance with voice, touch, or brief pauses. If your baby escalates, comfort and reset, then try again.

Another helpful strategy is gradual withdrawal: stay close at first, then reduce active help over several nights. This allows your baby to practice settling while still feeling supported.

The key is consistency. A baby who gets one response on Monday, a different one on Tuesday, and another on Wednesday has a harder time understanding what bedtime now looks like.

## Keep Bedtime Routine Short and Repeatable

A calm 15-25 minute wind-down is usually enough. You do not need a complicated sequence. You need a familiar one your family can repeat on hard days.

A practical routine is: quiet feed, diaper and pajamas, brief song or story, then cot. Same order, same cues, same tone.

## What Helps More Than Parents Expect

When cot sleep is difficult, daytime schedule fit often gets overlooked. If naps are too short and wake windows stretch too long, bedtime resistance rises fast. Protecting one or two better-quality daytime sleeps can make nighttime cot settling noticeably easier.

It also helps to track for a week. Notes on bedtime, wake windows, and wakings make patterns much clearer than memory at 3 a.m.

## When to Seek Extra Help

If your baby continues to wake very frequently with no improvement despite a consistent plan, or if sleep includes breathing concerns, poor feeding, fever, or signs of persistent pain, check in with your pediatrician. Medical contributors can look like behavioral sleep problems.

## Final Takeaway

If your baby won't sleep in cot right now, think progress, not perfection. Build predictability, keep responses calm and consistent, and give the new pattern several nights. Most families see meaningful change once routine and environment become steady.
