## Why Does My Baby Keep Waking Up?

If your baby is between 4 and 6 months old and suddenly started waking more frequently, you're not alone. This is one of the most common questions new parents ask — and the answer lies in how sleep cycles mature during this critical period.

Around 4 months of age, something remarkable happens in your baby's brain. Their sleep patterns shift from simple newborn sleep states to adult-like sleep cycles with distinct light and deep phases. This is a permanent, healthy change — but it comes with a temporary cost.

## What Changes at 4 Months?

During the first few months of life, babies cycle between just two sleep states. Around 4 months, their brains mature to cycle through multiple stages, just like adults do. Each cycle lasts about 45 to 90 minutes, and between cycles there's a brief period of light sleep — almost wakefulness.

Here's the key insight: **if your baby relies on external help to fall asleep (rocking, feeding, bouncing), they're likely to fully wake between each cycle** because the conditions that helped them fall asleep are no longer present. This is what pediatric sleep researchers call a "sleep onset association."

## The Numbers at This Age

Research from the American Academy of Pediatrics and leading sleep organizations tells us what to expect for 4-to-6-month-old babies:

- **Total sleep:** 14-16 hours per 24-hour period
- **Wake windows:** 1.5 to 2.5 hours between sleeps
- **Naps:** Usually 3-4 per day, often still short (30-45 minutes) but starting to consolidate
- **Night stretches:** Many babies begin sleeping 5-8 hours continuously

## Evidence-Based Strategies That Help

### 1. Establish a Consistent Bedtime Routine

Research consistently shows that a predictable bedtime routine improves sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) and reduces night wakings. A simple 20-30 minute sequence — bath, massage, pajamas, feed, book, bed — signals to your baby's brain that sleep is coming.

### 2. Practice "Drowsy but Awake"

This is the single most impactful skill you can build. Placing your baby in their sleep space when they're sleepy but not fully asleep gives them the opportunity to learn self-soothing. It doesn't have to be perfect every time — even occasional practice builds the skill over time.

### 3. Optimize the Sleep Environment

A dark, quiet room with consistent white noise helps prevent distractions during those vulnerable between-cycle transitions. At this age, babies are becoming increasingly aware of their surroundings, so a boring sleep environment actually works in your favor.

### 4. Watch Wake Windows, Not the Clock

Rather than scheduling naps by the clock, watch for your baby's tired cues within appropriate wake windows. An overtired baby has elevated cortisol, making it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep. For 4-to-6-month-olds, this means offering sleep after 1.5-2.5 hours of wakefulness.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Starting solids to improve sleep.** Despite popular advice, research does not show that introducing solid foods early improves sleep duration. Focus on sleep skills instead.

**Reverting to old habits indefinitely.** During a rough patch, it's natural to do whatever gets everyone back to sleep. The key is to gently work back toward independent sleep once things stabilize, rather than creating new long-term associations.

## When to Seek Help

If your baby continues to wake every hour for several weeks despite consistent routine changes, it's worth talking to your pediatrician. While frequent waking is normal during the regression period, persistent hourly waking could indicate something else is going on, such as discomfort, reflux, or an ear infection.

## The Good News

The 4-month sleep change is permanent — but that's actually a positive thing. It means your baby's brain is maturing exactly as it should. And once they learn to navigate these new sleep cycles, they have the ability to sleep much longer stretches than they ever could as a newborn.

With patience, consistency, and the right strategies, most families see significant improvement within 1-2 weeks of focused effort.
