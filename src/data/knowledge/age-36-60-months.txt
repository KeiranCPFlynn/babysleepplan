# Preschool Sleep (36–60 Months)

## Overview
Preschool sleep is shaped by behavior and routine more than feeding or immature sleep cycles. Most problems in this age group respond to consistent limits, healthy timing, and reducing bedtime stimulation.

## Key Points
*   **Total Sleep:** 10–13 hours per 24 hours.
*   **Nap:** Many children drop naps between 3–5 years. If no nap, bedtime may need to be earlier.
*   **Typical disruptions:** Bedtime fears, delay tactics, overtiredness, and inconsistent schedules.

## Strategy for this Age
*   **Consistent sleep window:** Keep a regular bedtime and wake time, including weekends.
*   **Calm pre-bed routine:** 20–30 minutes of low-stimulation activities (bath, books, quiet connection).
*   **Limit setting:** Use clear expectations and follow-through for staying in bed.
*   **Fear support without reinforcing wakefulness:** Validate feelings, then return to routine (brief checks, no long play/conversation).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
*   **Very late bedtime:** Overtired preschoolers often wake more at night and earlier in the morning.
*   **Screens close to bedtime:** Evening stimulation and light can delay sleep onset.
*   **Inconsistent rules across caregivers:** Mixed responses can prolong bedtime struggles.

## When to Seek Help
*   Loud frequent snoring, breathing concerns, or major daytime sleepiness.
*   Ongoing sleep issues that significantly affect daytime behavior or family functioning.
