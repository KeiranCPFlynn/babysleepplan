# Troubleshooting: Bedtime Resistance

## Overview
Bedtime battles (crying, stalling, refusing to lie down) can be stressful. They usually stem from timing issues or separation anxiety.

## Causes
1.  **Overtiredness:** The most common cause. If kept up too long, baby gets a "second wind" (cortisol/adrenaline spike) and becomes wired and hyperactive, fighting sleep.
2.  **Undertiredness:** Bedtime is too early relative to the last nap. Baby simply isn't sleepy.
3.  **Separation Anxiety:** Peaking at 8-10 months and 18 months. Baby fears separation from parent.
4.  **Boundary Testing:** Toddlers asserting independence ("No!").

## Solutions
*   **Find the Sweet Spot:** Watch for sleepy cues (staring, quietness) *before* the crankiness starts. If baby is fighting, try moving bedtime **earlier** by 20 minutes to catch the wave before overtiredness.
*   **Bedtime Routine:** A consistent 20-30 minute wind-down is non-negotiable. It cues the body for sleep.
*   **Screens Off:** No screens 1-2 hours before bed. Blue light suppresses melatonin.
*   **Bedtime Fading:** If baby naturally falls asleep at 9 PM but you want 7 PM, don't force 7 PM immediately. Start at 9 PM (no tears), then move it earlier by 15 minutes every few nights.

## Addressing Anxiety
*   **Special Time:** Spend 10 minutes of undivided connection time before the routine starts.
*   **Comfort Objects:** Introduce a lovey (if age appropriate).
*   **Check-ins:** For toddlers, use the "Excuse Me" technique ("I'll sit here, but excuse me, I need to check the oven, I'll be right back"). Always come back. This builds trust.

## The "Curtain Call" (Toddlers)
*   Toddlers calling out for water, hugs, potty.
*   **Solution:** The "Bedtime Pass." Give child one physical card they can use for one request. Once used, no more coming out.

## Common Mistakes
*   **Stimulating play before bed:** Wrestling/tickling raises adrenaline.
*   **Inconsistency:** If stalling works sometimes, they will do it every time.
