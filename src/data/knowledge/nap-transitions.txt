# Nap Transitions

## Overview
Dropping a nap is a major disruption. Doing it too early causes overtiredness; doing it too late causes bedtime battles.

## The Transitions

### 4 to 3 Naps
*   **Age:** ~4–5 months.
*   **Signs:** Refusing the 4th catnap, or bedtime getting too late.
*   **Handling:** Extend wake windows slightly. Bedtime might need to be earlier temporarily.

### 3 to 2 Naps
*   **Age:** ~6–9 months.
*   **Signs:** Consistently fighting the 3rd afternoon catnap.
*   **Handling:** Drop the 3rd nap. Typical schedule becomes 9:30 AM and 2:00 PM (approx). Bring bedtime earlier (e.g., 6:30 PM) to bridge the gap.

### 2 to 1 Nap
*   **Age:** ~14–18 months.
*   **Signs:** Refusing the afternoon nap entirely for 2 weeks, or playing through morning nap.
*   **Handling:**
    *   This is the hardest transition.
    *   **The "Switcheroo":** Toddler may need 1 nap some days, 2 naps others. Be flexible.
    *   Move the single nap to 11:30 AM/12:00 PM.
    *   **Crucial:** On 1-nap days, bedtime must be EARLY (e.g., 6:30/7:00 PM) to prevent overtiredness.

## General Tips
*   **Don't rush:** It's better to keep a nap slightly too long than drop it too early.
*   **Quiet Time:** If a toddler refuses a nap, enforce "quiet time" in the crib for 60 mins to rest.
*   **Bridging:** Use a micro-nap (15 mins) in the car/stroller if they can't make it to bedtime during a transition.

## Signs You Transitioned Too Early
*   Night wakings increase.
*   Early morning wakings (5 AM) start happening.
*   Toddler falls asleep at 4 PM.
