# Infant Sleep (9–12 Months)

## Overview
Sleep should be relatively stable with a solid two-nap schedule. Night weaning is typically fully possible. However, the 12-month regression can disrupt progress.

## Key Points
*   **Total Sleep:** 13–14 hours per 24 hours (~11-12 night, 2-3 day).
*   **Wake Windows:** 3–4 hours.
*   **Nap Schedule:** Solidly on 2 naps. Do not drop to 1 nap yet (high risk of overtiredness).
*   **Feeding:** Ideally no nutritional need for night feeds. Weaning off night bottles is recommended to protect teeth.

## 12-Month Sleep Regression
*   **Causes:** Walking (gross motor excitement), separation anxiety peaking again, teething (molars), and nap refusal (baby thinks they don't need naps).
*   **Duration:** Typically 2–4 weeks.
*   **Handling:** Maintain the schedule. Do not drop the second nap permanently even if they fight it for a week.

## Strategy for this Age
*   **Boundaries:** Baby may test limits (standing, throwing lovey out). Keep calm and consistent.
*   **Wind-down:** Activity levels are high (cruising/walking), so a longer wind-down routine may be needed to transition to sleep.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
*   **Switching to 1 nap:** Many parents mistake the 12-month regression/nap strike for readiness to drop a nap. Wait until 14-18 months.
*   **Giving up on training:** Reverting to rocking/feeding during the regression can create new long-term habits.

## When to Seek Help
*   If baby is waking extremely frequently and is also losing weight or not eating well in the day.
