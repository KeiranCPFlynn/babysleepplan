# Toddler Sleep (12–18 Months)

## Overview
This is the era of the big nap transition (2 to 1) and increasing independence. Bedtime battles may begin as toddlers test boundaries.

## Key Points
*   **Total Sleep:** 12–14 hours per 24 hours.
*   **Wake Windows:** 4–5+ hours.
*   **Nap Transition (2 to 1):** Usually happens between 14–18 months.
    *   *Signs:* Refusing afternoon nap consistently, or morning nap pushing bedtime too late.
    *   *Strategy:* When switching to 1 nap, move bedtime *earlier* temporarily to prevent overtiredness.
*   **Night Sleep:** ~11 hours.

## Challenges
*   **Independence:** Toddler realizes they have a say ("No sleep!").
*   **Teething:** Canines and molars can be painful and disrupt sleep.
*   **Nightmares/Fears:** Imagination begins to develop; simple fears may appear.

## Strategy for this Age
*   **Offer 2 naps until the 1-nap schedule is solid.** The transition can be bumpy ("switcheroo" phase where they need 2 naps some days, 1 other days).
*   **Security Object:** A lovey or blanket is very helpful now for self-soothing.
*   **Limits:** Be firm but loving about bedtime. Stalling tactics ("water," "book") increase.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
*   **Moving to a toddler bed too early:** Keep them in the crib as long as possible (ideally 3 years) to contain them. If they climb out, try a sleep sack to restrict legs first.
*   **Inconsistent rules:** If you give in to stalling once, they will try every night.

## When to Seek Help
*   If snoring is loud (enlarged tonsils/adenoids are common causes of apnea in this age group).
