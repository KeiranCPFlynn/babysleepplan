# Sleep Methodologies: Gradual / Middle Ground

## Overview
These methods allow for self-soothing but provide parental reassurance at specific times. They strike a balance between responsiveness and structure.

## Gradual Extinction (Ferber Method)
*   **How it works:** Put baby down awake. If they cry, wait for a specific interval (e.g., 3 mins, then 5, then 10) before checking.
*   **The Check:** Go in, pat/reassure verbally for 1 minute (do not pick up), then leave.
*   **Ages:** 5–6 months and up.
*   **Pros:** Evidence-based, works relatively quickly (3–7 nights), allows parent to check safety.
*   **Cons:** Crying is involved. Checks can sometimes enrage certain babies.
*   **Timeline:** Significant improvement usually seen by night 3 or 4.

## The Chair Method (Sleep Lady Shuffle / Camping Out)
*   **How it works:** Parent sits in a chair next to the crib while baby falls asleep. You offer verbal/physical comfort but don't pick up.
*   **Progression:** Every few nights, move the chair further away (middle of room, door, hallway) until you are out.
*   **Ages:** Good for babies with **separation anxiety** or toddlers.
*   **Pros:** Baby is never left alone; gentler transition.
*   **Cons:** Takes longer (2 weeks); baby may get mad that you are there but not holding them.
*   **Timeline:** 10–14 days.

## Bedtime Fading
*   **How it works:** If baby cries at 7 PM but sleeps at 9 PM, set bedtime to 9 PM (no tears). Gradually move bedtime earlier by 15 mins every few nights until you reach 7 PM.
*   **Pros:** Very little crying.
*   **Cons:** Requires managing a late schedule for a while.

## Who This Suits
*   Parents who want results but want to remain involved/present.
*   Babies who need reassurance but are capable of self-soothing.
