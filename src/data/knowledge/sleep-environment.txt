# Optimizing the Sleep Environment

## Overview
Before attempting any training, ensure the physical space supports sleep. A well-set-up environment can improve many common sleep challenges.

## The Checklist

### 1. Darkness
*   **Goal:** Keep the room low-light and consistent at sleep times; very bright, direct light is not ideal.
*   **Why:** Light cues wakefulness, and reducing evening/night light may support melatonin timing and sleep continuity.
*   **Tools:** Blackout curtains or portable blinds can help. A dim, warm nightlight can still be practical for feeds/comfort if kept indirect.

### 2. White Noise
*   **Goal:** Continuous, non-looping sound.
*   **Volume:** Keep it moderate (about 50 dB or lower at the crib level).
*   **Placement:** Place the machine away from the crib (around 7 feet / 2 meters when possible), pointed away from baby's ears.
*   **Why:** It may mask household noise (dogs, floors creaking) and provide a consistent sleep cue.
*   **Note:** Use plain white noise, pink noise, or rain. Avoid music/lullabies that change pitch/rhythm.

### 3. Temperature
*   **Goal:** 16–20°C (61–68°F).
*   **Why:** Babies sleep better in cooler environments. Overheating is a safety risk and causes restlessness.
*   **check:** Feel baby's chest or back. Hands and feet should be cool.

### 4. Sleepwear
*   **Swaddle:** 0-8 weeks (or until rolling signs). Dampens startle reflex.
*   **Sleep Sack:** 3 months+. A wearable blanket is safer than loose blankets. Use appropriate TOG (thickness) for room temp.
*   **Merlin Suit/Transition Products:** Useful for the transition out of swaddle (3-6 months), but must stop if baby can roll in the suit.

### 5. Crib Setup
*   **Boring:** No mobiles, light projectors, or toys in the crib. These stimulate the baby.
*   **Safety:** Flat mattress, tight sheet.

## Room Sharing vs. Own Room
*   **Safety:** Room sharing recommended for first 6 months.
*   **Sleep Quality:** Studies show babies (and parents) often sleep longer stretches once baby is in their own room (after 4-6 months), as they don't wake each other up with minor noises. Moving baby to their own room is a personal choice after 6 months.

## Real-World Flexibility
*   Every home and baby is different; adjust setup details based on what supports restful sleep and comfort while keeping safety standards in place.
*   If the environment is not "perfect," focus on the highest-impact changes first (consistent low light, manageable noise, and safe sleep setup).

## Transitioning Locations
*   If moving baby from your room to theirs, spend time playing in the new room during the day so it feels safe.
*   Keep the sleep environment (dark/noise/sack) identical in the new room.
