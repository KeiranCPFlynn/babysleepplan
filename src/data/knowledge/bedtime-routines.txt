# Bedtime Routines

## Overview
A consistent bedtime routine is the most potent behavioral tool for sleep. It cues the brain to release melatonin and wind down. Research shows consistent routines improve sleep latency (time to fall asleep) and reduce night wakings.

## Components of an Effective Routine
The routine should be **20–30 minutes** long and happen in the same order every night.

1.  **Bath:** (Optional but helpful). A warm bath lowers core body temperature afterward, which promotes sleep. It acts as a clear separation from "daytime."
2.  **Massage/Lotion:** soothing touch helps relaxation.
3.  **Diaper & PJs:** Put on overnight diaper and sleep sack.
4.  **Feed:** (Ideally do this *before* the very end to avoid feed-to-sleep association).
5.  **Book/Song:** Read 1-2 soothing books or sing a specific lullaby.
6.  **Bed:** Put baby down awake.

## Age-Appropriate Routines
*   **Newborns:** Simple 10-min routine (Diaper, Swaddle, Feed, Song).
*   **Infants:** Full 30-min routine. Feed should move earlier in the routine as they age.
*   **Toddlers:** Needs structure to prevent stalling. Use a visual chart if needed. Include "brush teeth."

## Consistency
*   Do the routine in the room where baby sleeps.
*   Keep voices low and lights dim.
*   **No Screens:** Avoid TVs/phones 1 hour before bed.

## Nap Routines
*   A shortened version of the night routine (5 minutes).
*   Example: Diaper -> Sleep Sack -> Curtains Closed -> Song -> Crib.

## Adapting as Baby Grows
*   As baby gets mobile, the routine might include "saying goodnight" to objects in the room.
*   For toddlers, offer choices ("Which PJs? Red or Blue?") to satisfy their need for control, but keep the routine steps fixed.
