# Older Toddler Sleep (18–24 Months)

## Overview
Toddlers are now firmly on one nap. The "18-month sleep regression" and "2-year regression" are major hurdles involving separation anxiety, language explosion, and boundary testing.

## Key Points
*   **Total Sleep:** 11–14 hours per 24 hours.
*   **Schedule:** One midday nap (~1.5–2.5 hours). Wake windows 5–6 hours.
*   **Regressions:**
    *   **18-Month:** Peak separation anxiety, teething, and independence seeking.
    *   **24-Month:** Language explosion, imagination (fear of dark/monsters), stalling, potty training awareness.

## Crib vs. Bed
*   **Recommendation:** Keep toddler in a crib. Most 2-year-olds lack the impulse control to stay in a bed.
*   **Climbing Out:** If they climb out dangerously and cannot be stopped, you may be forced to switch. If so, "childproof" the entire room and consider a gate at the door.

## Strategy for this Age
*   **Language:** Use their new language skills. Explain the routine ("First bath, then book, then sleep").
*   **OK-to-Wake Clock:** Can be introduced around 2 years to help with early waking or staying in bed.
*   **Fears:** Use a dim red/warm nightlight if afraid of the dark. Acknowledge fears but don't over-dramatize.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
*   **Dropping the nap:** Most 2-year-olds still need a nap. If they refuse, offer "quiet time."
*   **Negotiating:** Don't get into long arguments at bedtime. State the rule and move on.

## When to Seek Help
*   If night terrors are frequent or disruptive (distinct from nightmares).
