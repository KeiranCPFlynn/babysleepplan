# Troubleshooting: Short Naps

## Overview
A "short nap" is typically one sleep cycle (30–45 minutes). While normal for young babies, persistent short naps in older infants can cause overtiredness.

## Why Naps Are Short
1.  **Developmental (0-5 months):** Sleep cycles are immature. Short naps are biologically normal. Consolidation often happens naturally around 5–6 months.
2.  **Inability to Link Cycles:** Baby wakes at the end of the first cycle (45 mins) and doesn't know how to fall back asleep without help.
3.  **Environment:** Light or noise wakes baby during the light sleep transition.
4.  **Timing:**
    *   *Undertired:* Wake window too short; not enough sleep pressure to stay asleep.
    *   *Overtired:* Wake window too long; cortisol prevents settling into deep sleep.

## How to Extend Naps
*   **Darkness:** Use blackout curtains. Room should be pitch black.
*   **White Noise:** Continuous noise masks household sounds that trigger waking.
*   **"Crib Hour":** (For sleep trained babies 6m+) Leave baby in crib for a full hour even if they wake at 45 mins. Give them space to try and fall back asleep.
*   **Wake-to-Sleep:** Gently stir baby at the 30-minute mark (just enough to make them move/sigh). This can reset the sleep cycle and bridge the 45-minute gap.
*   **Timing Tweak:** Extend wake window by 10–15 minutes to increase sleep pressure.

## Normal vs. Problematic
*   **Normal:** A 3-month-old taking 4 x 30-minute naps. A baby napping short but waking happy and sleeping well at night.
*   **Problematic:** A 6-month-old taking 30-minute naps and waking up crying/tired, or short naps leading to a 5 PM bedtime and early morning wakes.

## Nap Training
*   Start with the first nap of the day (it's the easiest).
*   Use the same method as night training (e.g., checks or extinction).
*   Expect nap training to take longer than night training (2–3 weeks).

## Common Mistakes
*   **Rushing in:** Going to get baby the second they make a peep at 45 minutes denies them the chance to link cycles.
*   **Too much light:** Even a sliver of light can wake a baby in light sleep.
