# Cultural Considerations in Sleep

## Overview
Infant sleep practices vary widely across families and cultures. Some families prioritize independent sleep early, while others prioritize close nighttime proximity and co-regulation. Guidance should be practical, respectful, and free of blame.

## Culturally Responsive Framing
*   Ask about family goals first: safety, rest, breastfeeding, work schedules, and caregiving support.
*   Use neutral language (for example, "family sleep plan" rather than "good" or "bad" habits).
*   Adapt recommendations to real living conditions, including multigenerational homes and limited space.
*   Give one clear plan for all caregivers to reduce mixed messages at bedtime and overnight.

## What Safety Guidance Should Always Stay Constant
*   Follow core safe-sleep guidance: back to sleep, firm flat surface, and no loose bedding.
*   For infants under 1 year, the safest arrangement is room-sharing without bed-sharing.
*   Keep counseling nonjudgmental while still being explicit about avoidable risk factors.

## If a Family Is Bed-Sharing or Likely to Fall Asleep While Feeding
*   Use harm-reduction language without endorsing bed-sharing as equivalent to a separate infant sleep surface.
*   Emphasize "never bed-share" conditions: if the infant is under 4 months, preterm/low birth weight, or if any adult has smoked, used alcohol, cannabis, sedatives, or other substances.
*   Never sleep with an infant on a sofa, recliner, or heavily cushioned surface.
*   Remove pillows, duvets, and loose blankets near the infant and return infant to their own sleep space when possible.

## Bedtime Expectations Across Cultures
*   Later bedtimes, more room-sharing, and higher parental involvement at sleep onset are common in many regions.
*   Focus plan success on workable outcomes for this family (fewer prolonged wakings, safer routines, and improved caregiver sleep), not one rigid cultural standard.
