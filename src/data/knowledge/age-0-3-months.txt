# Newborn Sleep (0–3 Months)

## Overview
Newborn sleep is irregular, frequent, and driven by hunger. During the "fourth trimester," babies have no established circadian rhythm and require responsiveness rather than strict schedules.

## Key Points
*   **Total Sleep:** 11–17 hours per 24 hours.
*   **Wake Windows:** Very short, typically 30–60 minutes (up to 90 mins by 3 months).
*   **Sleep Pattern:** Irregular and around the clock. Sleep occurs in brief stretches (1–3 hours) due to small stomach capacity and frequent feeding needs.
*   **Day/Night Confusion:** Newborns often mix up day and night because they do not produce melatonin rhythmically yet. They may sleep long stretches in the day and be alert at night.
*   **Feeding:** Waking to feed every 2–3 hours is healthy and necessary.

## Fourth Trimester Concept
*   Babies this age need help regulating. They are not capable of "self-soothing" or "manipulation."
*   **Soothing:** Swaddling, shushing, rocking, and sucking (pacifier/feeding) mimic the womb and are essential tools.

## Strategy for this Age
*   **Fix Day/Night Confusion:** Expose baby to daylight and normal noise during the day. Keep nights dim, quiet, and boring with minimal interaction during feeds.
*   **Practice Safe Sleep:** Always place baby on back on a firm, flat surface.
*   **Flexible Routine:** You can start a simple cycle (Eat, Play, Sleep) but expect it to be messy.
*   **Sleep Training:** *Not appropriate* at this age.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
*   **Keeping baby up to "tire them out":** This leads to overtiredness and harder settling.
*   **Starting strict schedules too early:** Newborns are unpredictable.
*   **Letting baby nap >3-4 hours:** Cap daytime naps to ensure they eat enough during the day to support night sleep.

## When to Seek Help
*   If baby is extremely fussy/colicky and cannot settle even with comforting.
*   If baby is not waking to feed and not gaining weight properly.
