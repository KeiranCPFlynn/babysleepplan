# Red Flags & Medical Considerations

## Overview
While most sleep issues are behavioral or developmental, some signal underlying medical problems. It is critical to rule out physical discomfort or illness before attempting sleep training.

## Key Points

### When Sleep Issues Indicate a Medical Problem
*   **Extreme Irritability:** If a baby wakes screaming in pain regularly and is inconsolable, rather than just fussing for comfort.
*   **Poor Growth:** Frequent waking accompanied by poor weight gain or feeding difficulties.
*   **No Improvement:** If consistent sleep hygiene and training methods yield no improvement after 2+ weeks (e.g., baby still wakes every 45 minutes all night).

### Specific Conditions to Watch For
*   **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA):** Less common in infants but possible.
    *   *Signs:* Loud regular snoring (not just when sick), gasping, choking, snorting awake, pauses in breathing, mouth breathing, sleeping with head hyperextended, excessive sweating during sleep.
*   **Reflux (GERD):**
    *   *Signs:* Arching back while crying, frequent spitting up, coughing/gagging at night, waking screaming 30-45 minutes after being put down (when acid peaks).
    *   *Impact:* Pain worsens when lying flat. "Silent reflux" presents with pain but no spit-up.
*   **Allergies/Intolerances (e.g., Cow’s Milk Protein Allergy):**
    *   *Signs:* Blood or mucus in stool, persistent eczema, extreme fussiness/colic, gas.
    *   *Impact:* GI discomfort causes frequent night waking.
*   **Ear Infections:** Sudden onset of night waking and crying when lying flat, often following a cold.
*   **Iron Deficiency/Restless Legs:** Can cause extreme restlessness, thrashing, and frequent waking in older infants/toddlers.

### Conditions That Contraindicate Sleep Training
Do **not** start cry-based sleep training if:
*   Baby is ill (fever, ear infection, vomiting).
*   Reflux is uncontrolled and causing pain.
*   Baby is under 3–4 months old.
*   Baby is failing to thrive or needs night feeds for medical reasons.
*   Baby has severe separation anxiety due to trauma or recent upheaval.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
*   ** ignoring snoring:** assuming all baby snoring is cute or normal; loud/gasping snoring requires a doctor's check.
*   **Training through pain:** Attempting CIO when a baby has an untreated ear infection or severe teething pain.

## When to Seek Help
*   **Immediate:** Blue spells, difficulty breathing, or pauses in breathing >10 seconds.
*   **Consultation:** If baby snores regularly, arches back in pain constantly, or has eczema/digestive issues linked to poor sleep.
