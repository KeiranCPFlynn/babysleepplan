# Sleep Methodologies: Gentle / No-Cry

## Overview
These methods minimize crying by responding immediately to the baby and making gradual changes. They prioritize parental presence and comfort.

## Pick Up / Put Down (PU/PD)
*   **How it works:** When baby cries in crib, pick them up until calm. Once calm (but awake), put them down. Repeat until asleep.
*   **Ages:** Best for **4–8 months**. (Too stimulating for older babies).
*   **Pros:** Very responsive; parents feel less guilt.
*   **Cons:** Extremely labor-intensive. Can take 1 hour+ per night. Can be physically exhausting.
*   **Timeline:** 2+ weeks for results.

## The Pantley Pull-Off (Gentle Removal)
*   **How it works:** For babies who nurse to sleep. Unlatch baby just as they drift off. If they root/cry, re-latch. Repeat until they fall asleep without the nipple in mouth.
*   **Goal:** Break the sucking-sleep association gradually.
*   **Pros:** Very gentle, breastfeeding-friendly.
*   **Cons:** Very slow process.

## Shush-Pat
*   **How it works:** Instead of picking up, lean over crib and rhythmically pat baby’s back/bum while making a loud "shhhh" sound.
*   **Goal:** Soothe baby in the crib without removing them.
*   **Ages:** Good for younger infants (4-6 months).

## Gradual Withdrawal (Fading Support)
*   **How it works:** If you currently rock to sleep, rock until *almost* asleep, then put down. Next night, rock until drowsy. Next night, hold still without rocking. Fade out the help.
*   **Pros:** Low stress.
*   **Cons:** Requires high consistency; easy to get stuck at one stage.

## Who This Suits
*   Parents who practice attachment parenting.
*   Parents who cannot emotionally tolerate hearing their baby cry.
*   Families where time is not a pressing issue.
