# Night Weaning

## Overview
Eliminating night feeds encourages consolidated sleep. This should only be done if baby is growing well and pediatrician approves.

## Readiness
*   **Age:**
    *   **0-3 Months:** Not appropriate.
    *   **4-6 Months:** 1-2 feeds usually still normal.
    *   **6-9 Months:** Many babies can go 8-10 hours without feeding.
    *   **9-12+ Months:** Nutritionally, most healthy babies do not need night feeds.
*   **Weight:** Baby should be on a healthy growth curve.

## Methods

### 1. Gradual Reduction (Bottle)
*   Reduce the bottle by 1 oz (30ml) every night or every other night.
*   When you reach 1-2 oz, stop offering. Soothe baby other ways.
*   Alternatively, dilute formula with water gradually (for toddlers >12m).

### 2. Gradual Reduction (Breast)
*   Time the feed. If baby nurses 10 mins, reduce to 8, then 6, then 4.
*   Once short, cut the feed and settle with a pat/shush.

### 3. Stretching Intervals
*   If baby wakes at 12 AM, but you want to feed at 2 AM: soothe without feeding until 2 AM. Gradually push the time later.

### 4. Cold Turkey
*   Stop all night feeds at once.
*   Ensure baby gets extra calories during the day.
*   Partner (non-nursing parent) can handle night wakings for 3 nights so baby doesn't smell milk.
*   Effective but involves protest.

## Hunger vs. Habit
*   If baby eats a full meal at 3 AM -> **Hunger**. (Increase day food).
*   If baby sucks for 2 minutes and sleeps -> **Habit**. (Wean).

## Breastfeeding Considerations
*   **Supply:** Some moms keep 1 night feed to maintain supply. This is fine if it works for you.
*   **Reverse Cycling:** If baby is distracted in the day, they may binge at night. Fix day feeds (boring room) before night weaning.
