# Toddler Sleep (24–36 Months)

## Overview
At this stage, many children are strong-willed and language-heavy, so bedtime resistance often shows up as negotiation, stalling, and repeated requests. Sleep still improves most with clear structure and calm boundaries.

## Key Points
*   **Total Sleep:** 11–14 hours per 24 hours.
*   **Nap:** Usually one midday nap, often 1–2 hours.
*   **Wake Windows:** About 5.5–6.5 hours.
*   **Typical disruptions:** Separation anxiety spikes, big developmental leaps, fears, illness, and travel.

## Strategy for this Age
*   **Predictable routine:** Keep a simple bedtime sequence in the same order each night.
*   **Clear boundary language:** Use short, repeatable phrases ("It's sleep time now. I'll see you in the morning.").
*   **One last request rule:** Allow one final request before lights out to reduce repeated call-backs.
*   **Morning anchor:** Keep wake time consistent to stabilize bedtime and nap timing.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
*   **Late naps:** Naps ending too late can delay bedtime significantly.
*   **Over-negotiating:** Long back-and-forth conversations can reinforce bedtime resistance.
*   **Big schedule swings on weekends:** Large shifts often worsen night waking and bedtime battles.

## When to Seek Help
*   Persistent snoring, gasping, or breathing pauses during sleep.
*   Regular night terrors that are severe, frequent, or unsafe.
