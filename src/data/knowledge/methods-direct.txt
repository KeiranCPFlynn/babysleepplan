# Sleep Methodologies: Direct (Full Extinction)

## Overview
Full extinction, often called "Cry It Out" (CIO), involves removing parental intervention to allow the baby to learn self-soothing rapidly.

## How It Works
*   Perform bedtime routine.
*   Place baby in crib **awake**.
*   Say goodnight and leave the room.
*   Do **not** return for checks until the next scheduled feeding time or morning.
*   Monitor via video monitor for safety.

## Appropriateness
*   **Age:** **6 months+** is recommended. Some pediatricians approve at 4 months.
*   **Not appropriate for:** Babies with medical issues, vomiting from crying, or past trauma.

## Pros
*   **Speed:** Often the fastest method. Many babies sleep through by night 3 or 4.
*   **Clarity:** Less confusing for the baby. Checks (like in Ferber) can sometimes overstimulate or frustrate babies ("Why are you here but not picking me up?").
*   **Total Crying:** Research suggests total crying time over the course of training is often *less* with CIO than with gradual methods because it resolves faster.

## Cons
*   **Emotional Difficulty:** Extremely hard for parents to listen to.
*   **Extinction Burst:** On night 2 or 3, behavior often gets worse (crying harder/longer) before it gets better. This is normal.

## Safety Considerations
*   Ensure the environment is safe (safe crib, no loose bedding).
*   Ensure baby is fed, dry, and healthy before starting.
*   Both parents (if applicable) must be on board to maintain consistency.

## Common Misconceptions
*   **"It damages attachment":** Long-term studies show no negative impact on attachment or emotional health in children sleep trained with extinction, provided they are loved and attended to during the day.
*   **"Baby just gives up":** EEG studies show babies actually enter sleep states; they learn the skill of settling.

## Timeline
*   **Night 1:** Hardest (30-60+ mins crying possible).
*   **Night 2:** Often an "extinction burst."
*   **Night 3-4:** Dramatic drop in crying.
