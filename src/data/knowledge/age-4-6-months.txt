# Young Infant Sleep (4–6 Months)

## Overview
This is a major transitional period. Sleep cycles mature, circadian rhythms settle, and babies become capable of self-soothing. It is the age where sleep training often becomes an option.

## Key Points
*   **Total Sleep:** 14–16 hours per 24 hours.
*   **Wake Windows:** Lengthen to 1.5–2.5 hours.
*   **Naps:** Usually 3–4 naps per day. Naps may still be short (30-45 mins) but begin to consolidate.
*   **Night Sleep:** Many babies begin to consolidate sleep into longer stretches (5–8 hours).
*   **Feeding:** Night feedings may still be needed (1-2 times), but many healthy babies can go longer stretches. By 6 months, many can sleep through the night without a feed (check with pediatrician).

## The 4-Month Sleep Regression
*   **Cause:** Permanent change in brain function. Baby moves from newborn sleep states to adult-like sleep cycles with distinct light/deep phases.
*   **Effect:** Baby fully wakes between sleep cycles (every 45–90 mins) if they rely on external help (rocking/feeding) to fall asleep.
*   **Solution:** This is the ideal time to begin gentle sleep training or working on independent sleep skills (putting baby down drowsy but awake).

## Strategy for this Age
*   **Bedtime Routine:** Establish a consistent sequence (Bath, Book, Bed).
*   **Environment:** Move to a dark, quiet room (white noise) to prevent distractions.
*   **Skill Building:** Give baby the chance to fall asleep without being fully rocked or nursed to sleep to fix the regression issues.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
*   **Starting solids to improve sleep:** Evidence does not show that introducing solids early improves sleep duration.
*   **Reverting to old habits indefinitely:** During the regression, it's easy to start rocking/feeding to sleep again, which creates long-term associations.

## When to Seek Help
*   If baby wakes hourly for weeks with no improvement despite routine changes.
