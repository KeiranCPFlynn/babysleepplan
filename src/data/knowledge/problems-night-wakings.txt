# Troubleshooting: Night Wakings

## Overview
Frequent night waking is the most common parental complaint. Understanding *why* your baby is waking is the only way to solve it.

## Key Causes by Age
1.  **Newborns (0-3m):** Hunger, startle reflex, day/night confusion. *Normal.*
2.  **Infants (4-6m):** Sleep cycle maturation (4-month regression). Waking every 1-2 hours usually signals an inability to link sleep cycles without help.
3.  **Older Infants (6-12m):** Sleep associations (habit), teething, separation anxiety.
4.  **Toddlers:** Overtiredness, nightmares, behavioral stalling, screen time too close to bed.

## Sleep Associations (The #1 Cause)
*   **The Mechanism:** If a baby falls asleep with help (rocking/feeding), when they naturally wake between sleep cycles (every 45-90 mins), they realize that help is gone. They cry to have it restored.
*   **The Fix:** Teach baby to fall asleep independently at bedtime. Sleep onset associations are the strongest.

## Hunger vs. Habit
*   **Hunger:** Baby takes a full feed and goes back to sleep.
*   **Habit:** Baby sucks for a minute and falls asleep, or wakes every hour (impossible to be hungry that often).
*   **Solution:** Gently night wean (reduce ounces/minutes) if baby is age-appropriate and healthy.

## "Split Nights"
*   **Definition:** Baby wakes up happy/alert in the middle of the night and stays awake for 1–3 hours.
*   **Cause:** Under-tiredness (too much day sleep) or circadian mismatch (bedtime too early).
*   **Fix:** Cap naps, increase wake windows, or shift bedtime later. Do not stimulate baby during the split night.

## Realistic Timelines
*   **Sleep Training (Ferber/CIO):** Night wakings often reduce significantly within 3–7 nights.
*   **Gentle Methods:** May take 2–4 weeks for night wakings to subside.

## Common Mistakes
*   **Inconsistency:** Rocking the baby sometimes but not others confuses them and reinforces crying (variable reinforcement).
*   **Feeding to silence:** Feeding just to stop the crying when baby isn't hungry creates a habit.

## When to Seek Help
*   If baby wakes screaming in pain (red flag for reflux or ear infection).
*   If baby snores or gasps (red flag for apnea).
