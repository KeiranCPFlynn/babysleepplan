# Parent & Family Factors

## Overview
Sleep training involves the whole family. Parental mental health, work schedules, and relationship dynamics are critical variables in choosing a sleep plan.

## Parental Mental Health
*   **Depression/Anxiety:** Sleep deprivation is a major risk factor for Postpartum Depression (PPD).
*   **Method Choice:**
    *   A parent with high anxiety might find **CIO** intolerable and triggering. A gentle method is better for their mental health.
    *   A parent with severe depression/exhaustion might need the **fastest** solution (CIO) to restore their own sleep and function.
    *   *Note:* Improving baby's sleep often improves maternal mood significantly.

## Partner Disagreement
*   **Scenario:** One parent wants to train (CIO), the other wants to comfort.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Compromise:** Try a middle-ground method (Ferber).
    *   **Division of Labor:** The parent who tolerates crying better handles the checks/monitor. The other parent puts on headphones or goes for a walk.
    *   **Consistency:** Mixed messages (one parent rocks, one trains) are unfair to the baby. Agree on a plan for 1 week before evaluating.

## Single Parents
*   **Challenge:** No tag-teaming night wakings. Exhaustion is higher.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Prioritize *your* sleep. Safe co-sleeping or a faster training method might be necessary for survival.
    *   Call in support (friend/relative) for the first few nights of training if possible.
    *   Nap when baby naps on weekends.

## Returning to Work
*   **Pressure:** Working parents often need reliable sleep schedules.
*   **Daycare:**
    *   Babies often nap differently at daycare. Don't stress.
    *   Focus on an early bedtime on daycare days to compensate for poor naps.
    *   Ask daycare to support your schedule, but accept they have their own rhythm.

## Support
*   Sleep training is hard. If you feel at breaking point (rage, unsafe thoughts), put the baby in a safe crib and walk away for 5 minutes. Seek professional help.
*   A "good" sleep plan is one that the parent can actually stick to. Consistency is more important than the specific theory.
