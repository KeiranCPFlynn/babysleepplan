# Troubleshooting: Early Morning Waking

## Overview
Early waking is defined as waking for the day before 6:00 AM. It is one of the hardest sleep issues to resolve.

## Causes
1.  **Light:** Early dawn light triggers the brain to wake up.
2.  **Noise:** Birds, garbage trucks, or heating kicking on in the early morning light sleep phase.
3.  **Overtiredness:** Bedtime too late can cause early waking (cortisol prevents sleeping in).
4.  **Habit/Hunger:** Feeding at 5 AM reinforces the body to wake at 5 AM for digestion.
5.  **Too Much Day Sleep:** Baby has hit their 24-hour sleep max.

## Solutions
*   **Blackout Curtains:** The room must be pitch black at 5 AM. Use foil or travel blinds if necessary.
*   **White Noise:** Keep it running until you get them up to mask morning sounds.
*   **Earlier Bedtime:** Counter-intuitive, but try moving bedtime *earlier* by 20-30 minutes. More sleep at night often leads to later waking.
*   **Treat 5 AM as Night:** Do not start the day. Keep lights off, no play, minimal interaction. If they wake, treat it like a night waking.
*   **OK-to-Wake Clock:** For toddlers, a light that turns green when it's time to get up.

## Realistic Expectations
*   Biologically, a wake-up time between **6:00 AM and 7:00 AM** is normal for young children.
*   Trying to get a baby to sleep until 8 AM is often unrealistic.
*   "Larks": Some children are genetically early risers. You can shift them slightly, but likely not drastically.

## Common Mistakes
*   **Feeding immediately:** This rewards the early wake-up. Try to delay the first feed until your target wake time (e.g., 6 AM).
*   **Keeping baby up late:** "Tiring them out" usually backfires and causes earlier waking.
