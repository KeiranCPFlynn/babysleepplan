# Sleep Regressions

## Overview
A regression is a temporary period of poor sleep (waking, fighting naps) in a baby who previously slept well. They usually coincide with developmental milestones.

## The Big Ones

### 4-Month Regression
*   **Cause:** Permanent biological change in sleep structure (development of adult-like sleep cycles).
*   **Duration:** Permanent change.
*   **Handling:** This is the time to stop rocking/feeding to sleep and teach independent sleep. It does not "pass" on its own without adapting habits.

### 8–10 Month Regression
*   **Cause:** Object permanence (separation anxiety), crawling, pulling to stand, language development.
*   **Duration:** 2–6 weeks.
*   **Handling:** Practice new skills (sitting back down) during the day. Offer extra reassurance but stick to the routine. Don't start new bad habits (like bringing to bed) if you don't want to keep them.

### 12-Month Regression
*   **Cause:** Walking, separation anxiety, teething (molars).
*   **Duration:** 2–4 weeks.
*   **Handling:** Often mistaken for needing to drop to 1 nap. **Do not drop the second nap yet.** Keep schedule consistent.

### 18-Month Regression
*   **Cause:** Independence ("No!"), separation anxiety, teething (canines), 2-to-1 nap transition.
*   **Duration:** 2–6 weeks.
*   **Handling:** Be firm with boundaries. Introduce a nightlight or lovey for fears. Avoid power struggles.

### 2-Year Regression
*   **Cause:** Imagination (nightmares), potty training, climbing out of crib.
*   **Handling:** Keep in crib if possible. Use "OK to wake" clock. Re-training may be needed if habits slipped.

## What Not To Do
*   **Panic:** Don't change your whole schedule immediately.
*   **Create new crutches:** Try to offer comfort without reverting to rocking to sleep for hours, as you'll have to undo this later.

## When it's NOT a regression
If sleep is poor for >6 weeks, it's likely not a regression anymore—it's a new habit or a scheduling issue.
