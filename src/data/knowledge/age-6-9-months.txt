# Older Infant Sleep (6–9 Months)

## Overview
Sleep patterns become more predictable. Babies are physically capable of sleeping long stretches, but developmental milestones (crawling, object permanence) can cause temporary disruptions.

## Key Points
*   **Total Sleep:** ~14 hours per 24 hours (11-12 hours at night, 2-3 hours day).
*   **Wake Windows:** 2–3.5 hours.
*   **Nap Transition (3 to 2):** Around 8–9 months, most babies drop the third late-afternoon nap.
*   **Night Feeding:** Most healthy babies can sleep 8–12 hours without feeding. Night weaning is often appropriate now if weight gain is good.

## Milestones & Sleep
*   **8-10 Month Regression:** Caused by separation anxiety (object permanence) and motor skills (pulling to stand, crawling). Babies may wake crying for parents or practice skills in the crib.
*   **Physical:** Baby may stand in crib and get stuck/not know how to sit down.

## Strategy for this Age
*   **Schedule:** Aim for a consistent 2-nap schedule by 9 months (e.g., 9:30 AM and 2:00 PM).
*   **Skill Practice:** Practice sitting down from standing during the day so they don't get stuck at night.
*   **Separation Anxiety:** Use a predictable routine and consider introducing a lovey (if safe/pediatrician approved) or using a "chair method" for reassurance.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
*   **Dropping to 1 nap too early:** Most babies this age definitely still need 2 naps.
*   **Feeding for every wake-up:** At this age, frequent waking is usually habitual or anxiety-driven, not hunger.

## When to Seek Help
*   If snoring or mouth breathing is persistent (could be tonsils/adenoids issues surfacing).
