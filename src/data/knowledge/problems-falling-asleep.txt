# Troubleshooting: Difficulty Falling Asleep (Sleep Associations)

## Overview
If a baby cannot fall asleep without help at bedtime, they typically cannot stay asleep at night. This section explains sleep associations (often called "crutches" or "props").

## What Are Sleep Associations?
Conditions or objects a baby connects with sleep.
*   **Dependent (Negative):** Requires a parent. E.g., nursing, rocking, bouncing, car ride, being held, replacing a pacifier (for young babies).
*   **Independent (Positive):** Can be sustained by baby. E.g., sleep sack, white noise, low-light room, lovey, sucking thumb.

## The Problem
When a baby wakes between sleep cycles, they check their environment. If they fell asleep sucking a bottle but wake up without it, they are startled and cry. They need the "conditions of onset" recreated to return to sleep.

## How to Shift Associations
1.  **Identify the Crutch:** What is happening the exact moment baby falls asleep?
2.  **Gradual Removal (Fading):**
    *   *Feeding:* Feed earlier in the routine. Finish feeding, burp, read a book, then bed.
    *   *Rocking:* Rock until drowsy, stop rocking but hold until asleep. Then rock until drowsy, put in crib. Then put in crib awake.
3.  **Substitution:** Replace a parent-dependent association (rocking) with an independent one (white noise/lovey).

## Feeding to Sleep
*   Normal for newborns.
*   Becomes problematic >4 months if it causes frequent night waking.
*   **Goal:** Put baby down awake. The last 20 minutes before sleep should ideally be feed-free.

## Common Mistakes
*   **"Drowsy but Awake":** For older babies (>6 months), "drowsy" is often too asleep. They need to be fully awake to learn. "Drowsy" works best for 3-5 month olds.
*   **Inconsistency:** Nursing to sleep sometimes creates "intermittent reinforcement," making the habit harder to break.
